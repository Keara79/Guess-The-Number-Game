feat: Add guess the number game

This commit introduces a "Guess the Number" game to the project. The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. 
It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player narrow down their guesses. 
The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player and displays a congratulatory message upon guessing the correct number.
